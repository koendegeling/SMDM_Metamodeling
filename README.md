# HTAi Metamodeling Workshop

This is the repository for the short course on "Reducing the Computational Burden of Health Economic Models and Analyses Using Metamodeling" by Hendrik Koffijberg (University of Twente, the Netherlands) and Koen Degeling (Lumen Value & Access, Netherlands/United States) for Health Technology Assessment International (HTAi).

The repository contains three important files:

* `code.R`: the script containing the R code
* `objects.RDA`: the object containing the health economic model (HEM) and runHEM() function to run the HENM
* `HTAi_Metamodeling.Rproj`: the R Studio project file that can be loaded to set up R Studio session

The code illustrates the use of metamodels to address run time issues (i.e., the computational burden) of a health economic
simulation models to enable optimization. More details on the case study are provided in the `code.R` script.

We recommend to save all these files, or simply the whole repository, in a single folder, and use the `HTAi_Metamodeling.Rproj` to open R Studio, which ensures the working directly is set automatically. We also recommend to ensure you can run at least the INITIALIZATION section of the code before the live short course session.
